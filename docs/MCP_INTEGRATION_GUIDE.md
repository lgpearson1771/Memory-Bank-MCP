node tests/integration/quick-test.js
```

### 2. Test Server Directly
```bash
# Build and start server
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

### 3. Verify Tool Registration
- Check AI assistant for available MCP tools
- Look for 5 memory bank tools in tool list
- Test basic functionality with a small project

### 4. Monitor Logs
- Check VS Code Output panel for MCP logs
- Look for server startup messages
- Verify tool registration messages

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server not starting:**
   - Ensure `npm run build` completes successfully
   - Check that Node.js path is correct in configuration
   - Verify all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

2. **Tools not appearing:**
   - Restart the AI assistant application completely
   - Check server logs for errors in output panel
   - Verify MCP configuration syntax in config file

3. **Performance issues:**
   - Test with smaller projects first
   - Check available system memory
   - Monitor server logs for error messages

### Performance Benchmarks

The server has been tested with:
- **Small projects**: 10-50 files (< 100ms)
- **Medium projects**: 100-200 files (< 500ms)  
- **Large projects**: 500+ files (< 1000ms)
- **Memory usage**: < 100MB increase during operation

3. **Permission errors:**
   - Ensure the AI assistant has permission to execute Node.js
   - Check file paths are correct and accessible

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test compilation
npm run build

# Test server startup
node dist/index.js --help

# Verify tools registration
node scripts/test-server.js
```
