## 🛠️ Test Infrastructure

### Configuration Files
- `tests/integration/package.json` - ES module configuration for integration tests
- `config/jest.integration.config.cjs` - Jest configuration (legacy, not actively used)

### Test Execution
- **Node.js Direct Execution**: All tests run directly with Node.js for ES module support
- **Master Test Runner**: `tests/integration/run-all.mjs` orchestrates all test suites
- **Individual Test Suites**: Each test file can be run independently

### Test Utilities
- **Realistic Projects**: Dynamic project creation with actual file structures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in timing and memory usage tracking
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed success/failure analysis with metrics

## 🎯 Test Coverage Goals

### Functional Coverage
- ✅ **Project Analysis**: File scanning, framework detection, dependency analysis
- ✅ **Memory Bank Generation**: Core files, additional files, semantic organization
- ✅ **Validation**: Structure validation, Copilot sync, quality assessment
- ✅ **File Operations**: Directory creation, file writing, structure discovery

### Edge Cases Coverage
- ✅ **Empty Projects**: Projects with minimal or no files
- ✅ **Large Projects**: Projects with many files and deep structures
- ✅ **Malformed Data**: Invalid package.json, corrupted files
- ✅ **Permission Issues**: Read-only directories, access restrictions
- ✅ **Path Edge Cases**: Deep nesting, special characters, symlinks

### Security Coverage
- ✅ **Path Traversal**: Prevents access to files outside project scope
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: Handles malicious content in project files
- ✅ **Resource Limits**: Prevents memory exhaustion and infinite loops
- ✅ **Error Security**: Ensures error messages don't leak sensitive information

## 🚀 Running Tests

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. **Clear Test Names**: Descriptive test names explaining what is being tested
2. **Real Project Testing**: Use actual project structures rather than mocks
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track execution time and memory usage
4. **Comprehensive Assertions**: Test both positive and negative cases
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper setup and teardown of test projects

### Test Validation
1. **Production Readiness**: All tests must pass for production deployment
2. **Performance Standards**: Meet established benchmarks for all project sizes
3. **Error Resilience**: Handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure professional-grade output in all scenarios
