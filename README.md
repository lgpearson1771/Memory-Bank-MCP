# Memory Bank Generator MCP Server

> 🧠 Interactive Memory Bank Generation with Semantic Organization for AI-Assisted Development
>
> *2025 Microsoft Hackathon Project - Luke Pearson*

An interactive MCP server that generates comprehensive memory banks for GitHub Copilot, enabling persistent project knowledge across sessions. Features intelligent semantic folder organization and dynamic Copilot integration that adapts to your chosen project structure.

## 🚀 Vision

Transform how AI assistants understand and work with software projects by providing an **interactive workflow** that creates rich, contextual memory banks with **semantic organization** tailored to each project's specific needs.

## ✨ Interactive Workflow

### 1. **Project Root Selection**
When you request memory bank generation, the server first asks for your project's root directory - the folder where you want the `.github/memory-bank` directory created.

### 2. **Organization Strategy**
Choose your preferred structure:
- **Semantic Organization** (Default): Additional files organized into purpose-based folders
- **Flat Structure**: All files at root level for simple projects

### 3. **Customization Options**
Choose your preferred approach:
- **Standard Structure**: Complete memory bank with all core files
- **Custom Structure**: Tailored to specific focus areas and requirements

### 4. **Focus Areas** (Optional)
Specify areas requiring special attention:
- Complex algorithms or architectures
- API patterns and integrations  
- Testing strategies and frameworks
- Specific implementation patterns
- Performance-critical components

### 5. **Detail Level**
Select analysis depth:
- **High-level**: Overview and main concepts
- **Detailed**: Comprehensive analysis (recommended)
- **Granular**: Deep dive with extensive detail

### 6. **Additional Files** (Optional - Not Generated by Default)
**Only created when explicitly requested during customization:**
- API documentation → `api/` folder (if requested)
- Integration guides → `integrations/` folder (if requested)
- Testing strategies → `testing/` folder (if requested)
- Deployment procedures → `deployment/` folder (if requested)
- Security documentation → `security/` folder (if requested)
- Performance guides → `performance/` folder (if requested)
- Feature specifications → `features/` folder (if requested)
- Custom sections → User-defined folders (if requested)

**Note**: Without explicit requests, only the 6 core files are generated.

### 7. **Sync Validation** (Optional)
Enable comprehensive validation between memory bank files and Copilot instructions for perfect consistency.

│   └── [custom-folders]/         # 🔄 OPTIONAL: User-defined semantic folders
└── copilot-instructions.md       # ✅ Dynamically adapts to actual structure
```

#### Flat Organization (When additional files requested with flat preference)
```
.github/
├── memory-bank/
│   ├── [6 core files above]     # ✅ Always generated at root
│   ├── additional-file-1.md     # 🔄 OPTIONAL: Only when explicitly requested
│   ├── additional-file-2.md     # 🔄 OPTIONAL: Additional files at root level
│   └── custom-documentation.md  # 🔄 OPTIONAL: User-specified files
└── copilot-instructions.md      # ✅ Configured for flat structure
```

**🎯 Smart File Organization:**
- **6 Core Files**: ALWAYS generated at memory bank root level (no exceptions)
- **Additional Files**: ONLY generated when explicitly requested by user during customization
- **Semantic Categorization**: When additional files are requested, they're automatically sorted by purpose
- **Custom Folders**: User can define project-specific semantic folders for requested files
- **Dynamic Copilot Integration**: Instructions adapt to actual files generated (core + any requested additional files)
- **User-Driven**: Zero additional files created unless specifically asked for in customization options

## 🔧 Semantic Categories (For Additional Files)

### Automatic Categorization (When Additional Files Are Requested)
When users explicitly request additional documentation files, they are automatically organized based on content patterns:

| Category | Folder | File Patterns | Purpose | Generated When |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **Features** | `features/` | feature, component, module, functionality | Feature-specific implementation details | User requests feature documentation |
| **Integrations** | `integrations/` | api, integration, service, external, webhook | Third-party services and APIs | User requests integration documentation |
| **Deployment** | `deployment/` | deploy, infrastructure, docker, kubernetes, ci/cd | Deployment and infrastructure | User requests deployment documentation |
| **API** | `api/` | endpoint, route, controller, graphql, rest | API documentation and specs | User requests API documentation |
| **Testing** | `testing/` | test, qa, spec, e2e, unit | Testing strategies and frameworks | User requests testing documentation |
| **Security** | `security/` | security, auth, authentication, compliance | Security considerations | User requests security documentation |
| **Performance** | `performance/` | performance, optimization, benchmark, monitoring | Performance and optimization | User requests performance documentation |

**Note**: These folders are only created when users explicitly request additional files during the interactive setup process.

### Custom Semantic Folders
Define your own categorization:
```json
{
  "customFolders": [
    {
      "name": "analytics",
      "description": "Data analytics and reporting",
      "filePatterns": ["analytics", "reporting", "metrics", "dashboard"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Memory Bank Generation (Core Files Only)
```
User: "I'd like to generate a memory bank for my project"
Server: "What's the root directory for your project?"
User: "C:\MyProjects\WebApp"
Server: "Would you like semantic organization (recommended) or flat structure?"
User: "Semantic organization"
Server: "Standard structure or custom approach?"
User: "Standard"
Server: [Generates ONLY the 6 core files - clean and simple]
Result: ✅ 6 essential files at .github/memory-bank/ root level
```

### Memory Bank with Additional Files (Semantic Organization)
```
User: "Generate a memory bank focusing on API patterns and deployment"
Server: "What's your project root directory?"
User: "/home/user/api-service"
Server: "Any specific focus areas?"
User: "REST API patterns, authentication, Docker deployment"
Server: "Would you like additional documentation files?"
User: "Yes, I need API documentation, deployment guides, and security docs"
Server: [Creates 6 core files + api/endpoints.md + deployment/docker-guide.md + security/auth-patterns.md]
Result: Smart categorization into purpose-based folders for requested additional files
```

### Minimal Memory Bank (Core Files Only, Flat Structure)
```
User: "Create a simple memory bank for my small project"
Server: "What's your project root directory?"
User: "/home/user/simple-app"
Server: "Semantic organization or flat structure?"
User: "Flat structure for simplicity"
Server: "Would you like any additional files beyond the core 6?"
User: "No, just the essentials"
Server: [Generates only the 6 core files at root - clean and simple]
Result: ✅ 6 files total at .github/memory-bank/ + copilot-instructions.md
```

### Advanced with Custom Semantic Folders
```
User: "Set up memory bank with custom organization for my data pipeline"
Server: "What's your project root directory?"
User: "/projects/data-pipeline"
Server: "Any custom folder categories?"
User: "Yes, I need folders for data-sources, transforms, and monitoring"
Server: [Creates custom semantic folders and organizes files accordingly]
Result: data-sources/, transforms/, monitoring/ folders with smart categorization
```

### Validation with Sync Checking
```
User: "Validate my memory bank and check Copilot sync"
Server: "Enable comprehensive sync validation?"
User: "Yes, full validation"
Server: [Analyzes memory bank structure, semantic organization, and Copilot sync]
Result: ✅ 6 core files + 9 additional files organized in 4 semantic folders, fully synchronized with Copilot instructions
```

2. **During Work**: Memory bank provides consistent guidance
3. **After Changes**: Update memory bank to capture new insights
4. **Session Reset**: Fresh Copilot relies entirely on memory bank

## 📊 Memory Bank Categories

- **Project Context**: Goals, requirements, and scope
- **Technical Context**: Technologies, dependencies, and setup
- **Active Context**: Current focus, recent changes, next steps
- **System Patterns**: Architecture, design patterns, relationships
- **Progress**: Status, accomplishments, known issues
